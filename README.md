# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The goal of this analysis was to provide our client, Louise, with data to help her make a decision on kickstarting her own play. She requested information on how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

The analysis was performed by utilizing the dataset we had previously set up, and further adjusting the data and adding graphical elements. Using pivot tables to summarize the data, we created two graphs, one of  the outcomes by the month of the year they launched, and another of the outcomes based on the goal funding amount.

### Outcomes by Launch Date

For the first analysis, we created a pivot table breaking out the outcomes (successful, failed, or canceled) by the month they were launched. Using this pivot, we could easily add a line graph that would let us visually analyze if a specific month brought about better outcomes.  See image below.

### Outcomes Based on Goals

The second analysis utilized countifs to extract specific data, breaking out play kickstarters by the goal funded amount and their corresponding outcome. This is one of my favorite functions, letting you add multiple variables to "filter" the data set. We then summarized this data by the percentage of each outcome, graphing it according to the goal funded amount.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

I utilize excel daily, so this exercise wasn't particularly challenging. However, I can see how the more advanced features of excel, pivot tables and graphs, could easily be challenging for  other users. Both have many features, and learning which ones to use when takes practice. Also, excel has hundreds of functions. The ones we encountered in this exercise are relatively simple, but I know even some daily excel users might not be aware of them.  

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

Early summer, specifically May, is a good time to start a fundraiser, as we can see an increase in successful outcomes compared to others. Failed fundraisers however stay relatively flat, indicating that starting on a specific month won't necessarily doom the campaign.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Smaller campaigns are more likely to succeed, with failures beginning to outpace success at the $15k mark, though ideally under $5k. $35k-$45k also sees an uptick,  possibly for larger high-profile fundraisers.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

If we're looking to determine whether a play would be a successful kickstarter, knowing the genre would also be helpful. Comedies might have a better success rate than historical dramas, for example. Additionally, it would be nice if the locations were more specific. Smaller towns are less likely to have a large theater scene, compared to larger metropolitan areas. Including them in the same data set could skew the data.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

I noticed the data included whether the fundraisers were staff picks or spotlights. I'd imagine this would heavily influence the outcome of a fundraiser, so a stacked column chart breaking out success/failures by whether or not they were promoted would be useful.
